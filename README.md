# User Accounts :-
A user account is a digital identity used to log in to a system.
• Examples:
Your email account
Your Instagram or Facebook account
   A login account on a computer or company system
Each user account usually has:
Username
Password
Sometimes OTP / fingerprint / face ID
  Why user accounts are important:
They identify who is using the system
They help track user activity
They prevent unauthorized access

# Permissions:-
Permissions decide what actions a user is allowed to perform.
Common permissions:
Read – view files
Write – create or edit files
Execute – run programs
Delete – remove files
Example:
A student can view study material (read)
A teacher can edit marks (write)
An admin can install software (full access)

# Access Control:-
Access control is the process of allowing or denying access to resources based on rules.
Example:
Only HR staff can access salary data
Only admins can change system settings
Employees can access files only during office hours

#Types of Access Control (Easy Explanation)
 
 1️⃣ Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Owner decides who can access data

📌 Example:
You share a Google Drive file and choose who can view or edit
 
 2️⃣ Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
System decides access based on security rules

📌 Example:
Government or military systems
Files marked as Top Secret, Confidential, etc.

 3️⃣ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access is based on job role

📌 Example:
Admin → full access
Manager → reports only
Employee → limited access
✔ Most common in companies

 4️⃣ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Access depends on conditions

📌 Example:
Access allowed only if
User is from HR
Login is during office hours
User is in company network

# Why Access Control is Important:-
Prevents data theft
Stops unauthorized changes
Protects confidential information
Helps meet security compliance# Cyber-security-Elevate-Lab-second-task

# Administrative vs standard user privilege:-
1.Administrative User (Admin):-
Users with full control over the system.
What they can do:
Install or remove software
Change system settings
Create, delete, or modify user accounts
Access all files
Configure security settings
Risk:
If hacked, the attacker gets full system control

2. Standard User:-
Users with limited access for daily tasks.
What they can do:
Use installed applications
Access personal files
Change basic settings (like wallpaper)
Browse the internet
Limitations:
Cannot install software
Cannot change critical system settings
Cannot manage other users

# Best OS Hardening Practices:- 
1.Update regularly – Install OS and software updates to fix security bugs

2.Remove unused software – Less software = fewer attack chances

3.Disable unnecessary services – Turn off features you don’t use

4.Use strong passwords – Long, unique passwords for all accounts

5.Limit admin access – Use admin rights only when required

6.Enable firewall – Blocks unwanted network access

7.Install antivirus/antimalware – Protects against viruses and malware

8.Create user accounts properly – Give users only needed permissions

9.Enable logging & monitoring – Helps detect suspicious activity

10.Backup data regularly – Protects against data loss and ransomware
